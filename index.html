        <p>In March 2018, I attended a the monthly SeattleJS MeetUp in downtown Seattle. Normally I would avoid traveling to downtown because of traffic and because of the hassle of finding parking. I made an exception since they were giving a talk on TypeScript. This was one of those time where I do things without wanting to think much about it and the end result was very positive.</p>
<p>I met an older gentle named Mark during the event, who looks like he could be my father. I knew he would have a lot to share and I was right. After 15 years working in tech, Mark is now working in construction. He pointed out the slow evolving nature of construction, and he thinks there are a lot of opportunities for innovations there. I totally agreed with Mark and thought he was brilliant.</p>
<p>With more trust in Mark, I wanted to get his advice on developer productivity. </p>
<p>In the early days, I was doing designs with HTML and CSS. This ended up taking a lot of time and my design abilities were limited because I used both sides of the brain at once—solving logic problems and thinking in design. I eventually buckled down and learned to design with Sketch Design and learned to create artifacts with Gimp. Sure enough, in no time, I began to see improvement in my designs. My workflow was also getting better, and I was feeling very happy and productive.</p>
<p>Up until a week before attending the MeetUp, when I felt completed exhausted. Almost like how I was feeling when I was doing designs work with HTML and CSS. I had a backlog on Trello that felt like it was never going to be finished. More and more, I was starting to feel unease but didn’t want to stop making progress on the backlog. With 15 years in tech, I knew that Mark would be the one to talk to about developer productivity. After hearing me out, he responded: “You need discipline.” Pausing for a long second, then Mark went on to explain further. At the moment, I thought to myself “More discipline?”. I tried my best not think and only listen.</p>
<p>Mark explained to me the importance of taking breaks and keeping a healthy active routine. It made sense to me because we evolved from hunting and gathering people. Our physiology doesn’t allow us to sit 12 hours a day for months on.</p>

<p>Before we were able to finish, the MeetUp talk had resumed and we went back to our seats. On the way home that night, I thought about Mark’s remark of needing discipline. Even though the physiology reasoning didn’t pertain to me because I was going to the gym regularly. In fact, I look forward to going to the gym because I would get to socialize and meet with friends. And twice a day, I would take breaks to take our dog, Charlie, out before picking my sister from school. Staying active and taking small breaks were really not a problem. Yet, I was still thinking about “discipline”, then I realized there is another aspect to my situation with the endless backlog. My problem has to do with feature/design creeping. I made the mistake of falling into the loop of design and code and sometimes, adding more features in the middle of the development cycle. I realized it’s demoralizing to working on something for a long time and feeling like nothing is achieved. </p>
<p>When working on big projects by alone, you’re more prone to make this mistake of falling into the endless development cycle, and feeling like no progress is made. To avoid this, you need to be clear on what needs to be accomplished in each cycle, and you need to be disciplined not to add, or modify, things in the middle of a cycle. Also, don’t hold back on celebrating successes. Celebrating small milestones helps boosting morale. And every little boost you get will contribute to making a better product, better code, and ultimately a happier you!</p>

        <p>Hello world, my name is Tanner Phan. I’m a software developer based in Seattle, WA. In college, I wanted to study Computer Engineering, but instead, I had a mix of Physics, Math, and Computer Software before dropping out and worked on a start-up with a group of awesome people.</p>
<p>The truth is I was unhappy with the learning experience, and I was getting tired of hoops I needed to jump through in order to learn to write software. I was determined to learn how to write software, and later on, I even found I have the aptitude for Machine Learning - Shout out <a href="https://udacity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udacity</a>!</p>
<p>The people I started my first start-up with are now my life-long friends. Unfortunately, the start-up didn’t survive the Market Test. Being the only developer, it was extremely tough for me to make the decision to stop the development process. As the saying goes “fail early, fail graciously”. Ultimately we came to the conclusion that the future is not where we thought it would be for content maker, and we celebrated our journey to that point. The site was served more than ten thousand times, to over a thousand people before it went offline.</p>
<p>I was not going to let no-school stopping me from learning the skills I need. And I think this is an important mentality. You need a resilient mentality to survive the journey of becoming a software developer. For me, understanding why I want to learn to write software so badly helped me get through the bad days when nothing seems to work. My dedication towards software stems from my desire to contribute to building a better world of tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, first thing first. What makes you want to write software more than breathing?</p>
<p>Cheers to the future of creativity of everybody,</p>
<p>-Tanner P.</p>
<p>Note: I will mostly blog about writing software, and will occasionally talk about entrepreneurial related topics as well.</p>
